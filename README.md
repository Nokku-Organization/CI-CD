# CI-CD

## Devops
Devops describes paradigm shift of an organization towards improved collabaration,communication,integration between software developers and IT operations

Devops Principles:
Include Automation of:
- Iac(Infrastructure)
- Testing(unit,integratin,performance,security-penetration test)
- Deployment(Zero down time)
- Monitoring
- Security(user management , security testing)


## Continous Integration:
- CI is a software development practice in which developers regularly merge thier code changes in to central repository after which automated build and tests are run.
- Key goal of CI are to find and address bugs quicker,improve software quality and reduce the time to validate , release new software updates.
- Here code from source(git/codecommit) is pu

## Continous Delivery:
- CD is a software development practice where code changes are automatically build,tested and code changes are prepared for production.
- Actually this deployment to production(transistion from tested-staging-environment to production environment) involves manual step(manual approval or invlovement)

## Continous Deployment:
- If application life cycle is fully automated i.e, even transition i above Continous delivery is automated , then that is contionus as continous deployment.
